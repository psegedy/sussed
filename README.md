# 🕵️‍♂️ sussed

> **Because life is too short to live in a mid apartment.** 👨‍🍳🔥

Imagine being **delulu** enough to manually refresh real estate portals in 2026. **Skill issue.** `sussed` is an AI-powered real estate agent that susses out the market so you don't have to. The name comes from the Slovak word **"sused"** (neighbor), because we find your future neighbors before they even know you're moving in. It crawls the **sus** listings, parses the data, and alerts you when it finds a deal that actually **ate**.

## ✨ Why `sussed`?

* **Main Character Energy:** Why look for a home when the home can find you? 💅
* **Zero Mid Listings:** Our agent filters out the "cozy studios" (closets) so you only see the **W** deals.
* **Sussing the Sused:** We analyze the neighborhood vibes so you don't end up living next to an NPC.
* **No Crumbs Left:** High-speed parsing ensures you're the first to the viewing. **Fr fr.**

## 👨‍🍳 The Recipe (How it works)

- **The Sniff:** The agent scrolls through portals like it's on TikTok, looking for new drops.
- **The Suss:** AI translates "vibrant neighborhood" to "loud AF" and "lots of potential" to "this place is falling apart."
- **The Glow Up:** You get a clean notification only when a deal is valid.

Four property types are supported out of the box: **apartments**, **houses**, **cottages** (chata/chalupa), and **garden plots** (zahrada/zahrádka). Each has its own AI review skill + example hunt config.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.14+, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), and Docker/Podman for PostgreSQL.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sussed.git
cd sussed/sussed

docker compose up -d         # fire up the DB
uv sync                      # install deps
uv run sussed db init        # create tables
uv run sussed scrape -c brno -m 5   # grab some listings
uv run sussed hunt -c search_config.yaml --scrape   # score them
```
